# Music_Advisor
This program interacts with Spotifyâ€™s API, makes preference-based suggestions and even shares links to new releases and featured playlists : )

My version of Jet Brains Academy Music Advisor Project - stage 5/5.

Thanks Jet Brains Academy, for this very educational project, I learned a lot making authorization requests, processing responses,
running a callback server and processing received requests. To better organize the code I also separated the user interface from the business 
logic and data access logic following the MVC pattern.
